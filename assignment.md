# Python Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to install python and text editor, and to familiarize yourself with the environment and basic feature so that you can start writing code.

## Part 0: Fork and clone the repo

You should make your own copy of the repository so that you can edit it and at the end submit a pull request.

1. Create a fork of this repo by clicking on the **Fork** link in the upper right.
2. Checkout your personal copy of the repo: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/python-intro1`

### How to submit?
1. `git add filename` (or `git add .`) for all the files you want to add.
2. `git commit -m "Message describing what you did"`
3. `git push origin master`
4. Now if you go to your personal copy on github, your changes should be there: `https://github.com/<username>/python-intro1`
5. From there, click on **Pull Requests** and then **New pull request**.

Ideally, you should regularly run steps 1-3. This will save your work as you go. And if you ever goof things up, you will have all the history, you can revert any file to how it was at any previous commit!

## Python and text editor installation
Install Python and a programming text editor and write a program that prints one line other than 'hello world', then take two screen shots and save them to <b>./python-intro1/screen_shot</b> directory. And then submit it as above submit guide. You should use the command line to execute the Python program you wrote in the text editor. Please do *not* use the IDLE Python Shell, the Python Interpreter (>>>), or a shortcut in your text editor to run the code. Later in the class when we start reading files, we will need to be able to run Python programs from particular directories. 

## Your first coding
By editing ./src/print_my_name.py file, write a program that uses a print statement to say 'Hi <<your_name>>' as below 'Desired Output'.

Desired Output: 
            <b>Hi <<your_name>></b>
